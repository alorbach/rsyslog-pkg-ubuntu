rsyslog-pkg-ubuntu
==================

This respository contains the sources needed to build Ubuntu rsyslog
packages. It is our goal to create the best possible packages for
the current releases for this platform.

Currently, packages are available at
   http://www.rsyslog.com/ubuntu-repository/
   
... but we plan to move to PPAs.

Contributors and co-maintainers are welcome.
